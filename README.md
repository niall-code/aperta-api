# Aperta API

This Django REST Framework API (Application Programming Interface) is designed to serve as the back end of my full-stack portfolio project, Aperta.

The repository for the front end can be found here: https://github.com/niall-code/aperta

## Design, Development, and Deployment Process

### Initial Setup

I created a GitHub repository from Code Institute's project template, then created a Gitpod workspace from that.

I installed Django and Django REST Framework, as well as dependencies regarding cloud-hosted images. I then started a Django project.

> `pip install django==3 djangorestframework django-cloudinary-storage Pillow`
>
> `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
>
> `django-admin startproject aperta_api .`

In `aperta_api/settings.py`, in `INSTALLLED_APPS`, I added 'cloudinary' and 'rest_framework' at the bottom, and 'cloudinary_storage' above the existing 'django.contrib.staticfiles'.

### Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

I looked at my repository from the Moments walkthrough project's API, to see how my Django models were constructed there. I used those as a starting point, removed a couple of attributes from Profile that currently seem unnecessary, altered the names of various attributes to increase their clarity to me, added some important new attributes, particularly 'green_listed' in my Post model, and planned two additional models, namely Block and Report.

I consulted a Code Institute tutor, Sarah, while writing my Follow model. She solidified my understanding of the similar Follower model in Moments by clearing up a confusion over its seemingly ambiguous use of the words "following" and "followed" as 'related terms'. In my own model, I have replaced those with "follows" and "followers", respectively. Therefore, when I want to know who I have followed, I should be able to query something like `me.follows.all()`, and if I wanted to know who is following me, I should be able to query something like `me.followers.all()`.

### Cloudinary Setup

I created an env.py file, which will be git-ignored. In it, I set my Cloudinary URL as an environment variable. I then added code to my settings file to retrieve that from the environment and make Cloudinary my default image storage location, as taught during the Moments walkthrough.

### Starting Apps

I ran `python manage.py startapp <app_name>` seven times, with the app names being profiles, posts, likes, comments, follows, blocks, and reports. I then added those to my installed apps in my settings file.

### Mentor Meeting and ERDs

I had a Project Inception meeting with my Code Institute mentor, Gareth McGirr. He suggested that a 'reported' attribute in my Post model could be helpful and reminded me of my forgotten intention to have 'reason' and 'explanation' attributes in my Report model. Here are my updated ERDs:

### Create Profile model

I added the appropriated code to `profiles/models.py` and `admin.py`, taking example from Moments but adjusting it for the differences I planned in my ERD. I have included a stylistically different default profile picture, an outline-based avatar rather than shading-based. I then created a superuser, running:

> `python manage.py makemigrations`
>
> `python manage.py migrate`
>
> `python manage.py createsuperuser`

To check that the profile creation functionality was working, I ran `python manage.py runserver`, received an error message screen as expected, added the development workspace URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS like it advises, and was rewarded with the screen shown below.

I then appended `/admin` to the address, logged in with my new superuser account, and saw that a profile had indeed been created and the Cloudinary path for the default profile picture was being successfully interpreted when hovered, as seen below.
